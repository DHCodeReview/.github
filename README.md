# DH Community Code Review

Welcome to the website of the Community Code Review Working Group of DHTech!

Code review is a widespread technique to improve software and reduce the number of flaws. In a code review, a programmer (other than the original code author(s)) reviews the source code. They ask questions and make suggestions for improving the software. In addition to identifying and eliminating errors, code review can improve overall quality by making the source code more readable and maintainable.
